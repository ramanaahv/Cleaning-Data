#Description of Variables and Tranformation Done
#Steps For Transformations:
1. read all the 3 files under the directory test (subject_test,X_test,Y_test)
2. combine all 3 using cbind by combining first X_test with subject_test and then Y_test.
3. read all the 3 files under the directory train (subject_train,X_train,Y_train)
4. combine the 3 files in step3 using cbind by combining first X_train with subject_train and then Y_train .
5. combine files in step2 and step4 using rbind.Now we will have a big table of 563 variables and 10299 observations.
6. Read the table fields from features.txt.
7. grep the rows with mean and standard and store that in 2 different variables mean_cols and std_cols.
8. now extract a subset of table in step5 by the column numbers present in the 2 variables in above step.
9. give the column names to the subset of the table in step8 the same names corresponding from features.txt.
10. now extract another subset of table from step5 containing only the last 2 columns and give them the names as subject and activity.
11. Combine thesubsets from step 9 and step 10 using cbind.
12. Now replace the integer values in activity to the corresponding string as in activity_labels.txt
13. Now using the melt function extract the data having the Subject and ACtivity as constants and rest all as variables.
14. Now find the mean of all the varibales based on the constant variables using dcast 
15. Finally order the table based on subject and activity and write it to a new table.
