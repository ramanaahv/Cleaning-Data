#Goal

To Analyse Human Data Activities for which the data have been collected from mobile device gyrometers used by the test subjects while performing various activities.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data is available at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The aim of the project is to clean and extract usable data from the above zip file. 

In this project, you find:

Analysis.R : the R-code run on the data set
Tidy.txt : the clean data extracted from the original data using Analysis.R
CodeBook.md : the CodeBook reference to the variables in Tidy.txt
README.md : the analysis of the code in Analysis.R

#Data
The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

#Description of Variables and Tranformation Done
#Steps For Transformations:
1. Read all the 3 files under the directory test (subject_test,X_test,Y_test)
2. Combine all 3 using cbind by combining first X_test with subject_test and then Y_test.
3. Read all the 3 files under the directory train (subject_train,X_train,Y_train)
4. Combine the 3 files in step3 using cbind by combining first X_train with subject_train and then Y_train .
5. Combine files in step2 and step4 using rbind.Now we will have a big table of 563 variables and 10299 observations.
6. Read the table fields from features.txt.
7. Grep the rows with mean and standard and store that in 2 different variables mean_cols and std_cols.
8. Now extract a subset of table in step5 by the column numbers present in the 2 variables in above step.
9. Give the column names to the subset of the table in step8 the same names corresponding from features.txt.
10. Now extract another subset of table from step5 containing only the last 2 columns and give them the names as subject and activity.
11. Combine thesubsets from step 9 and step 10 using cbind.
12. Now replace the integer values in activity to the corresponding string as in activity_labels.txt
13. Now using the melt function extract the data having the Subject and ACtivity as constants and rest all as variables.
14. Now find the mean of all the varibales based on the constant variables using dcast 
15. Finally order the table based on subject and activity and write it to a new table.
